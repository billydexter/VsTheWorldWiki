		<h2>MORADO</h2>
		<p><i>"I am Morado. Master of Knives."</i><br>-Morado, <i>VS THE WORLD</i></p>
		<div class= Row>
		<div class= PadTheRight>
		<p><strong>Morado</strong> is the second child of <a href = "./ziza.html">Ziza</a>, and is a major antagonist throughout <i>VS THE WORLD</i>. He is a skilled assassin who is an expert in agility, speed, and with knives. He is very stoic and serious, and also takes no nonsense from anyone. He is shown to have incredible abilities, like being able to rend space with his knives, defeat an entire gang by himself, and to survive a car crash without a scratch. Although Morado is portrayed as a stoic, fearless, emotionless character, he actually bottles up a lot of his emotions and has a lot of hatred toward his mother, and his military cohort, <a href="./avesty.html">Avesty</a>, because they killed his best friend, <a href="./destyl.html">Destyl</a>. Although he secretly doesn't want to be the bad guy and hates killing, he is too afraid of his mother to stand up to her.</p>
		<p>
			Morado appears frequently throughout <i>VS THE WORLD</i> as an antagonist, but Destyl's backstories show him as Destyl's best friend and more humanized than his later portrayals. He originally had two eyes, but Ziza stabbed one of them out.

		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p font-size="26px">In <i>VS THE WORLD</i></p>
		<h4>Prologue</h4>
		<p>Morado originally appears in <i>VS THE WORLD</i> in the <a href="../../html/Chapters/prologue">prologue</a>, where he introduces himself and, along with Morado and Fireboss, threatens the people of Liberty Square to give up <a href="./ethan.html">Ethan</a> to them or to die. He initially gives Ethan a day where she promises not to kill him, humoring him, but only does this because he wants to kill him later and humiliate him while doing it.</p>

Morado eventually lures Ethan into a place where his execution will be broadcast to all of Provo, but Ethan escapes by kicking Morado where it counts. Ethan runs away, and Morado chases him in extreme anger. Ethan calls <a href = "./steven.html">Steven</a> and <a href = "./kendra.html">Kendra</a> to pick him up to save himself from Morado. Morado reports his failure to Ziza, who acts very angry, and tells Morado that he has one more chance to redeem himself, or else "he'll end up like his sister".</p>

		<div id = "spoilText1" style = "display: none">
			<p>In Chapter 7, the heroes have just saved Provo and the world from being destroyed by Fireboss and the Volcano Jewel, but Morado decides to chase them and to attempt to assassinate them. Most of Chapter 7 is Ethan, Steven, Kendra, <a href = "./melissa.html">Melissa</a>, and Deppe running away from him. Morado eventually corners them at an arena, where he prepares himself to destroy all of them. Everyone meets him at the arena, and Morado comes to fight the heroes. He stabs them with four knives, knocking them out, until Melissa is the only one left. Melissa is visited by Destyl, which lets her survive a knife, and that makes Morado very nervous, but he rejects his sister and keeps fighting. Destyl keeps Melissa alive, and she defeats Morado, who is shaking with fear that he let his mother down again.</p>
			<p>Morado then begs his mother for a second chance, and his mother grants it to him, but after Morado really apologizes. She uses Avesty's disappearance to furthermore convince him to serve her and to be afraid of her. Morado agrees, and seeks to kill Ethan again in Chapter 9..</p>

		<h4>Chapter 9</h4>
		<p id = "spoilWarning2" style= "color:red">Spoiler Warning. Click button below to reveal spoilers</p>
		<p id = "spoilText2" style="display: none">In Chapter 9, Morado seeks to defeat Ethan again, who is with <a href = "./ultrastar.html">Ultrastar</a>. Morado is Ultrastar's older brother, so he knows Ultrastar, but he ignores this fact. He continually seeks to fight Ethan and Ultrastar and tries to destroy them, as well as Deppe and Steven, but the four of them find their way out and eventually make it to Provo.</p>

		<h4>Chapter 12</h4>
		<p id = "spoilWarning3" style= "color:red">Spoiler Warning. Click button below to reveal spoilers</p>
		<div id = "spoilText3" style="display: none">
		<p>In Chapter 12, Morado is the first obstacle you find, guarding the controls for the front gate so that Ethan and co. can let their Provo army into Ziza's palace. Morado initially fights Ethan and Steven, but is stopped by Melusa, who skips Ethan and co., and goes straight for Morado for some reason. Steven actually defends Morado, who barely escapes with his life, and Steven gets petrified in the process.</p>
		<p>For the remainder of Chapter 12, you don't really see Morado, until when Ethan is alone with Ultrastar. Morado apologizes for his actions and asks to join Ethan to stop Ziza, with Destyl and Ultrastar, his two half-siblings, on his side. Ethan agrees, and the four of them move on to fight Melusa and Ziza. Morado is originally very scared to fight his mother, but he slowly eases into it when he sees his sister is on his side. </p>
		<p>
			After you beat the final boss, Morado thanks you for finally setting him free, and that he is going on a journey to find out who he is. He was completely controlled by Ziza, a puppet, but after she died, Morado is free, but he doesn't know what that means, so he travels on his own to figure it out, knowing he won't be welcome on earth for all of the murders and hostile takeovers he has done. Ethan says that he will "pull some strings" to get Morado to see Destyl's funeral, and that if he ever wanted to come to earth, Ethan would secretly let him, seeing that Morado's repentance is genuine.

		<div class = "PadTheSider">
		<h3>Personality</h3>
		<p>Morado is completely controlled by Ziza, and is her last loyal son after the other two rebelled against her. He does everything to please her, and is completely loyal because he is afraid. He does reckless and hard things, and shows no fear, because nothing compares to his fear of his mother. He is shown to be pathetic, and to cry and beg when he's losing to win, as shown in the battle against Melissa. Morado is also secretly very lonely and very dissatisfied with his life, but he has no one to vent to or no one that he loves after Avesty killed Destyl. Through Destyl's backstories, before Ziza motivated him out of fear, he was playful, determined, and even a bit naive. Morado felt a little down on himself as a kid, because Destyl was always significantly more powerful than he was, but the two were great friends, understood each other very well, and got along very well.</p>
		<h3>Relationships</h3>
		<div id = "spoilText4" style="display: none">
			<h4>Ziza</h4>
			<p>
				Ziza does not think very highly of Morado, because she compares him to Destyl, who was always much stronger than he was in battle, and so she sees him as a failure. She knows that Morado is terrified of her, so she threatens him with torture and with disrespect in order to make get him on her side.
			</p>
			<h4>Avesty</h4>
			<p>
				Morado secretly holds a lot of feelings of hatred for Avesty, because she murdered his <a href = "./destyl.html">best friend</a>. Avesty thinks that Morado is very attractive, and tries to seduce him, which is actually pretty disturbing because she is disguising as his sister. Morado holds back a lot of anger toward Avesty and forces himself to work with her.
			</p>
			<h4>Ethan</h4>
			<p>
				Morado constantly chases after Ethan, and does have a bad feeling in his mouth toward him, but slowly grows to respect him.
			</p>
			<h4>Destyl</h4>
			<p>
				Probably Morado's most important interaction and most positive one was that with Destyl. Morado loves Destyl and sees her as someone that he really connects with. He looks up to his big sister, and she takes care of him. They would always talk, and it's the only real interaction between two of Ziza's side that is truly... Good. Morado and Destyl would fight together, play together, have real talk, and would love each other. When Destyl decided to rebel against Ziza, and Morado started to talk to her about it, Ziza stabbed out his eye, and told him that more injury would come to him if he listened to his sister. Morado feels a great loss for his sister and it contributes to a lot of his anger and apathy toward others, and he secretly cries when he's alone.
			</p>
			<h4>Ultrastar</h4>
			<p>
				Morado was somewhat of a bystander when Ultrastar was a kid. Ziza and Avesty were abusive toward him, but Morado didn't do anything nor connect with his new brother, because of 1- the age gap, and 2- he wasn't like Destyl. Morado didn't want another sibling... He wanted his sister back. Because of that, Morado was very businesslike with Ultrastar and would not help him with his problems, hardened and depressed by his own loneliness.
