		<p><i>"I don't care who my heir is...<br>...I measure people by how useful they are to me."</i><br>-Ziza, <i>VS THE WORLD</i></p>
		<div class= Row>
		<div class= PadTheRight>
			<p><strong>Ziza</strong>, also known as <strong>Hazel,</strong> is the main antagonist of <i>VS THE WORLD</i>. Despite her harmless look, Ziza is a sociopath who doesn't feel emotion, and she uses that to exploit the weaknesses of others. She is not all-powerful, but is most dangerous in her manipulations and planning. She wants to conquer everyone and prove that she can defeat anything with her wits.</p>
			<p>
				One of Ziza's greatest desires is to gain more power, so she wants to have an heir that will continue her legacy when she dies and she can completely control to wipe out tons of people. Because of that, she had three children with some of the strongest men she's met in the universe, <a href = "./destyl.html">Destyl</a>, <a href = "./morado.html">Morado</a>, and <a href = "./ultrastar.html">Ultrastar</a>, although she sees all of them as flawed.

They do, and Ethan does not want to kill Ziza, but in her one last act to prove her dominance, she commits suicide because she wants to remain in control until the end.

			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<p>Ziza is completely emotionless, but is very intelligent on how to portray them to others. She knows how to manipulate people very well and personally to them. She purposely makes herself look plain to deceive others. She is strong, but not all-powerful, and has the ability to rend space, as do her children in some capacity. She does not care for her children and just cares that she has a successor. She considers emotion to be a weakness and prides that she feels nothing. She wants to have power over all others and that's why she takes over worlds and wants so bad to defeat Ethan.</p>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<div id = "spoilText4" style="display: none">
				<h4>Destyl</h4>
				<p>
					Until Destyl rebelled against Ziza, she was Ziza's pride and joy. Ziza wanted Destyl to grow up to be her heir, and treated her very well, like a princess. However, when Destyl rebelled, Ziza started to fear Destyl, while she is used to fearing nothing. They have an intense rivalry with each other, and Ziza's hatred for Destyl is one of her only traces of emotion in her. 
				</p>
				<h4>Avesty</h4>
				<p>
					Ziza sees Avesty as someone useful to her and someone easy to manipulate emotionally, because Avesty is so angry all the time at everything. She strings Avesty along, saying "If you do this, then I will love you", while ultimately throwing her away when she wants Avesty to cause more destruction out of her rage. Avesty still wants very much to impress her, and Ziza does give her anything she wants as long as Avesty does the same. She does not consider Avesty to be her true heir and truthfully does not respect her.
				</p>
				<h4>Morado</h4>
				<p>
					Ziza looks down on Morado and sees him as a disappointment, knowing that he secretly hates her. She knows that the best way to control him is out of fear, so she threatens him that "he will die like Destyl did". Morado is actually Ziza's most loyal child, but she looks down on him because he is weak compared to Destyl.
				</p>
				<h4>Ultrastar</h4>
				<p>
					Like Morado, Ziza sees Ultrastar as a disappointment and not nearly as strong as Destyl, so she tries the same fear tactics as Morado, letting Avesty emotionally abuse him. She also does not see him as a threat, and treats him like a joke.
