				<p>Zoe is the secondary protagonist of Chapter 5, where she is with Melissa, trying to figure out what Morado and Avesty's plans are. She is shown in this chapter to struggle getting out of bed and eating, while Melissa does her best to encourage and to help her when she struggles. Zoe occasionally leaves the party out of fear or out of embarassment, such as when Avesty calls her fat. She is very attached to Melissa, who takes her under her wing, and always will come back when Melissa is in trouble. She slowly figures out that Avesty is trying to take the Volcano Jewel from the museum and helps Melissa to confront Avesty, but runs away when Avesty flees to the Volcano.</p>

			<div id = "spoilText1" style="display: none">
				<p>Zoe is the main playable character in Chapter 8, where she is alone in her room. Two of her roommates (Amanda and Melissa) were murdered, and she is incredibly depressed. Ziza's army has taken over Provo, and Zoe is placed under watch by a <a href = "./champions.html">Flora Champion named Lotus</a>. Zoe's depression keeps her from doing some daily tasks that Ziza's army requires, which leads Lotus to take pity on her. Zoe is about to give up, feeling completely alone, and considers taking her life. But Destyl comes and tells her that she has a big role to play and that she can do so much. Zoe accepts that if her life is not worth living, she might as well try to do something good with it. Lotus finds Zoe as she's trying to sneak out, and agrees to escort her to avoid suspiscion. Zoe's story about losing Melissa convinces Lotus to join the good side, and they start a rebellion against Ziza.
				</p>
				<p>
					Zoe rescues <a href = "./kendra.html">Kendra</a> from Avesty, and the three of them start a revolution to take back Provo, which they do. Zoe then leads the army to Ziza's palace, where they seek to destroy Ziza and all of the harm she brings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Zoe becomes a main party member at this point, being the spiritual successor to Melissa, and for the second half of the game, your main party is Ethan, <a href = "./steven.html">Steven</a>, Kendra, Silva, and Zoe.

			<h4>Chapter 12</h4>

			<div id = "spoilText2" style="display: none">
				<p>In Chapter 12, Zoe prepares all of the rebellion to march into the palace and to give everything they can to get Ethan to Ziza. She goes with Ethan, Steven, Kendra, and Silva to open the gate, and then leads everyone inside. After a huge battle and a fight with Ajax, Melusa shows up to petrify Zoe's army, and they all fall, one by one. Zoe sees her friend, and tells Ethan, Kendra, and Silva that she will talk to Melissa, and try to get through to her. Melusa sees Zoe, and fights herself to not kill her. Zoe begs Melusa not to fight, but Ziza's control is too much, and Melusa fruitlessly defeats her friend. In a rage that she just petrified her best friend, Melusa destroys every Champion in the room with her, leaving no one but Ziza safe.</p>
				<p>
					After everyone defeats Ziza, there is a funeral for Melissa and Destyl. Zoe cries a lot and lets all of her emotions out, while her new friends comfort her. One of the last scenes is Zoe sitting under a tree, feeling depressed and lonely for the death of her best friend. Ethan joins her, and they have a moment of empathy, and there's a little hint that there might be something more there...

			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<p>Zoe is extremely shy and introverted in the beginning of the game and struggles with depression. She often feels like she is a burden to others and that people don't want to talk to her because she's not pretty and not worth keeping around. Her mother left her husband and took her five kids with her, because her father was an abusive alcoholic. Her mother had to work many minimum wage jobs to keep them afloat. One of her older brothers is abusive and another is in jail, her younger sister took her life (hinted at), and her younger brother is autistic. Zoe often feels that her background makes her beyond loving. She went on a mission but went home after 6 weeks because her depression and anorexia was too much for her. However, Zoe is very loving and compassionate toward everyone, and people secretly really root for her based on her tragic past. Zoe is not very pretty or sociable, but she is extremely kind to her friend Melissa, and is a lot more down to earth. However, in the latter part of the game, Zoe demonstrates a huge amount of courage and altruism that eventually leads to Ziza's demise.</p>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
				<h4>Melissa</h4>
				<p>
					Melissa and Zoe are best friends, and Zoe brings out a more compassionate, charitable part of Melissa that she doesn't know she has. Zoe is pretty attached to Melissa, and Melissa prioritizes her well-being over everything else, including her other friends, boys, and others. Melissa was Zoe's trainer on her mission, and at first, Melissa disliked Zoe and thought she was lazy, but soon saw how hardworking Zoe was with her depression and anorexia. Melissa motivates Zoe to overcome her mental illnesses, and is very positive toward her.
				</p>
				<h4>Avesty</h4>
				<p>
					Zoe and Avesty have a very interesting relationship, because Zoe is the only character Avesty has any empathy toward. Avesty and Zoe both had bad parents, and Avesty is fascinated how Zoe ended up a good guy with her situation. She goes so far to help Zoe (As long as it doesn't help anyone else), and to avoid insulting her when she seeks to tear people apart emotionally, although Avesty ultimately is not changed by Zoe.
				</p>
				<h4>Lotus</h4>
				<p>
					Lotus secretly feels sorry for Zoe, as when she is placed as Zoe's guardian, Lotus feels very bad for Zoe's depression and rage over Melissa's disappearance and occasionally tries to fill her role by encouraging her to eat and get up, despite that Champions are not supposed to speak. Lotus eventually feels so touched by Zoe's story and pain that she convinces Zoe to never give up, and rebels against her entire livlihood at great risk because this should not cause Zoe so much pain. After that, Lotus becomes a great advisor and help to Zoe, encouraging her and being a great friend after Ziza is defeated.

			<h3>Trivia</h3>
