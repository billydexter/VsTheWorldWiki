		<div class= Row>
		<div class= PadTheRight>
			<p><strong>Destyl</strong> is the oldest child of <a href = "./ziza.html">Ziza</a> and is her sworn enemy. Destyl grew up as her loyal servant, unaware that Ziza's violent and horrible actions were wrong. After the event with the general, Destyl decided that Ziza was evil, and rebelled, during which Ziza killed her. Destyl, being half angel, made a prophecy that Ethan would be the one to defeat Ziza, which led Ziza to come to earth and to attempt to kill <a href = "./ethan.html">Ethan</a> in the first place. Destyl continues to fight against Ziza as a spirit, where she leads the main characters by giving them tutorials, and she assists them with helpful advice.</p>
			<p>
				Destyl is one of the most powerful characters in the game, with powers over space and intense healing powers. She is also the strongest of Ziza's children.

				<p>After you finish every chapter, you will play a short scene controlling Destyl, giving a bit of a backstory behind her, Ziza, Morado, and Avesty.</p>
				<h4>Chapters 1-7</h4>
				<p>
					Destyl appears usually at the start of every chapter to give some tutorials on how to play the game. 
				</p>
				<h4>Chapter 8-11</h4>
				<p>
					Destyl is a lot more of a supporting role at this point, after the great tragedy at the end of chapter 7. Destyl supports Zoe and Ethan when they are about to give up, in Chapters 8 and 9 respectively. It is notable that Destyl is not there in Chapter 10, for this is where Melissa is being brainwashed.
				</p>
				<h4>Chapter 12</h4>
				<p>
					Destyl has a lot more of a role in Chapter 12, where she is a playable character outside her backstories. She opens the Mirror of Silence for the main characters to get into the Road of Silence, and gets them out to Ziza's inner sanctum. When Ethan and Ultrastar reaches Ziza's chamber and are about to have the final showdown with her and Melusa, Destyl gains enough power from Melusa's aura and becomes solid as long as Melusa is alive. She, Ethan, Ultrastar and Morado all fight Melusa. After everyone defeats Ziza, Destyl says that she can finally go to rest, her body appears, and there is a great funeral honoring her bravery.

			<p id = "spoilWarning1" style= "color:red">Spoiler Warning. Click button below to reveal spoilers</p>
			<div id = "spoilText1" style="display: none">
				<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
				<p>
				In Chapter 1, Destyl is shown killing a man in a tent after Ziza tells her to. Destyl seems a bit nervous about it, not because of the morality, but rather because she wants to do it right.
				</p>
				<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
				<p>
					In Chapter 2, Destyl is shown duelling with Morado, who is friendly and has two eyes. Destyl beats him, but then heals him, and Morado tries to fight again.
				</p>
				<h4>CHAPTER 3- CHAPTER 10- TBA</h4>
				<h4>CHAPTER 11</h4>
				<p>
					After Chapter 11, you play as Morado, who goes across a barrier Destyl sets as a sanctuary. Destyl is very defensive and suspicious of Morado at first, but Morado tells her that he is proud to her brother and that he wants to rebel against Ziza with her. Destyl agrees, and gives Morado a hug. Morado then breaks her neck, and it is revealed that it was Avesty in disguise. Ziza then adopts Avesty as her princess, and Morado holds back his feelings, but does not rebel against his mother.

			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<p>Destyl has a deathly serious side, but also has a mischiveous, whimsical side about her, as shown in her tutorials and her interactions with Morado. She is very caring, and despite her power, is very vulnerable emotionally since her experience with the General. She loves Morado very much, and requests that Melissa does not kill him at the end of their battle. She is also quite emotionally intelligent, and can empathize with Ethan and Zoe in their lowest moments. She is very determined to defeat her mother, but is a bit ashamed to use her power, considering how much damage she did to innocent people under Ziza's control.</p>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
			<div id = "spoilText2" style="display: none">
				<h4>Ziza</h4>
				<p>
					Until Destyl rebelled against Ziza, she was Ziza's pride and joy. Ziza wanted Destyl to grow up to be her heir, and treated her very well, like a princess. However, when Destyl rebelled, Ziza started to fear Destyl, while she is used to fearing nothing. They have an intense rivalry with each other, and Ziza's hatred for Destyl is one of her only traces of emotion in her.
				</p>
				<h4>Avesty</h4>
				<p>
					Avesty killed Destyl, so Destyl is not allowed to be near her. Destyl is ashamed of Avesty and hates her, because she took her place and killed her.
				</p>
				<h4>Ethan</h4>
				<p>
					Destyl has a lot of trust in Ethan, and sees him as an extension of her, or her successor. She does everything she can to motivate and help him, and although Ethan sometimes does not trust her, Destyl is very patient with him and tries everything she can to help him.
				</p>
				<h4>Morado</h4>
				<p>
					Destyl's best friend and person she cares about most is Morado. Morado is Destyl's younger brother, and she looks after him and wants him to succeed. They got along very well as kids, being raised like royalty, and Destyl would give Morado tips on battling. Ziza would often belittle Morado, saying that he would never be as good as Destyl, but Destyl would always try to get him to cheer up. She always believes in Morado and wants him to overcome his fear, and doesn't want him to die, as shown in Melissa's battle against him. In fact, her love and trust in Morado is the weakness Avesty finds in her that lets Avesty deceive and kill her.
