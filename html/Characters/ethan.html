			<h3>Biography</h3>

			<h4>Prologue</h4>

Morado and Avesty take this bluff seriously, and tell Ethan he has a day to live before they kill him. Ethan meets Destyl, who tells him that standing up to Morado and Avesty has made him fulfill a prophecy, where he is the chosen hero to defeat a conquerer named Ziza. Ethan goes to campus, and he meets <a href = "./ultrastar.html">Ultrastar</a>, who fights him because he's the hero.

			<div id = "spoilText0" style="display: none">
				<p>Ethan is also the main playable character in Chapter 1. Ethan is assaulted by many enemies, and is slowly more and more convinced that he doesn't want to be the hero any more, unlike his fantasies about what he wanted. Throughout the chapter, he texts Melissa about everything, and learns about her bravery, and he agrees to a date with her. While getting ready he meets Cynthia, a girl from his math class who flirts with him in his apartment, although Ethan thinks she's a bit selfish. Ethan runs out even before Cynthia can get a good-bye hug. He meets Melissa on the date, and it goes really well, because both of them have had really crappy dates the past couple of times.</p>
				<p>Ethan loses his phone for a little bit, which bothers him, because he can't text Melissa anymore, and he searches everywhere, but cannot find it. Ethan goes back to campus, where Morado tricks him and corners him, telling him that he's going to kill Ethan in the most humiliating way possible, to show what happens to those who rebel against Ziza. Ethan kicks Morado where it counts and runs for his life. Ethan calls Steven to pick him up while running away, and he successfully gets away.

				<p>
					In the raid of Ziza's palace, Destyl says that the main goal and the only way to save the world is to get Ethan to Ziza in her quarters. Ethan doesn't want his friends to die for him; it's one of the reasons why he dislikes being the hero, but everyone agrees to fight for him. But inside Ziza's palace, everyone finds that Ziza has weaponized and brainwashed Melissa and calls her Melusa, and she makes her an invincible petrifying machine with godlike strength. One by one, his friends, Steven, Zoe, Kendra, and Silva, get petrified, and Ethan barely makes it to Ziza's quarters.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Ziza's quarters, Melusa hit Ethan's back with an arrow and that makes it so he has difficulty standing and can barely walk. Ethan is about to give up again, but Destyl gives him enough strength to continue forward, and Ethan makes it to heal himself. Ethan goes further into the sanctum and has one last showdown with Ultrastar, who Ethan convinces to join him in the final fight against Melusa and Ziza. In the fight against Melusa, Ethan is the most important character, because his connection with Melissa and his care for her makes her realize that she's brainwashed, and convinces her to destroy herself to save the world and all worlds from Ziza.
				</p>
				<p>
					After everyone defeats Ziza, Ethan goes back to earth to have some peace for a second. He has a tender moment with <a href = "./zoe.html">Zoe</a>, who is crying under a tree for the death of her friend, and Ethan empathizes with her, and they take a minute to honor their fallen friend. There is a hint that Zoe and Ethan might start something after, but nothing is confirmed.

			<h3>Personality</h3>
			<p>Ethan is a quirky, funny, and sometimes awkward guy who is very nice and respectful toward everyone. He is self-critical and does not give himself enough credit, which is one of his main flaws he overcomes throughout the adventure. Although he is usually scared, if he sees that there is no other way to handle a situation, he is capable of impressive acts of bravery. Ethan also has trouble with loving himself, and he believes that no girl will love him and he wants someone very loyal- shown in the beginning of the game before he became close with Melissa and after she dumped him. Ethan cares a lot for his friends and does not want them to die for him. He also struggles with accepting that he is a prophecied hero, and doubts his own abilities. He thinks that someone else would do a much better job than he would, while really he is the perfect person for the job, simply because he treated Melissa well and gave her hope in guys again.</p>
			<h3>Relationships</h3>
				<h4>Steven</h4>
				<p>
					Ethan is Steven's cousin, and he looks up to and admires his cousin. Steven is a lot more confident and chill than Ethan is, but they are good friends since Steven was born, and they would do anything for each other. Steven likes to have Ethan around even while hanging out with his girlfriend, Kendra.
				</p>
				<h4>Silva</h4>
				<p>
					Ethan and Silva are good friends, and served together as companions on their missions. They have a lot of inside jokes between each other, and they are both somewhat shy and lack confidence, but they really can act like themselves around each other. They talk about video games a lot, and trust each other.
				</p>
				<h4>Melissa</h4>
				<p>
					Ethan and Melissa eventually get into a relationship, with Melissa thinking that Ethan is pretty handsome and seems like a nice boy, after her boyfriend cheated on her and her roommate's boyfriend tried to cheat on his girlfriend with her. They are very cute at the beginning, where you see them nervously text each other, and eventually they come into a relationship. Melissa often motivates Ethan to be the hero when he has no other motivation otherwise. Melissa's family disapproves of Ethan, and Ethan starts to be a little clingy with Melissa, so for Chapter 7, cracks form in their relationship, but neither want to break it off because Ethan wants someone to love him, and Melissa wants a boy who is loyal and won't cheat. Melissa eventually breaks it off under Ziza's control to harm Ethan emotionally. Ethan becomes angry at Melissa, but never acts on that anger, and is still very kind to her. That kindness touches Melissa and ultimately is Ziza's undoing.
				</p>
				<h4>Destyl</h4>
				<p>
					Ethan sees Destyl as his mentor and someone to help him when he's feeling down. He sometimes hates Destyl's advice and ignores it out of fear, but he eventually comes to trust her, and the two work together well. He is sometimes frustrated at her, but the two work together well. 
				</p>
				<h4>Ultrastar</h4>
				<p>
					Ultrastar sees Ethan as his greatest rival and obstacle, while Ethan sees Ultrastar as an annoyance and a bother, but just accepts the fact that this random flashy guy wants to kill him. Ethan grows to respect and feel sorry for Ultrastar as he gets to know why he does the things they do, but feels frustrated that Ultrastar won't just join his side. At the end of the game, the two become friends and great allies.
				</p>
			<h3>Trivia</h3>

				<li>Ethan is heavily based on Nathan Driggs, the creater of VS THE WORLD</li>
				<br>
